    In the heart of our villages, horse gram (huruli) was never just a grain – it was a trusted friend in every home.

    At <strong>SwasthSip</strong>, we’ve taken that tradition and turned it into a tasty, soulful drink that fits perfectly into today’s fast-paced life.

    this ganji is both nourishing and nostalgic.
