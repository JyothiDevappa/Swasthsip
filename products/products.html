        <h2>🌱Huruli Pulse – The Ancient Secret to Modern Strength</h2>
        <p> In the heart of our villages, horse gram (huruli) was never just a grain – it was a trusted friend in every

          on a winter morning, it has always been part of India’s quiet wisdom.

          At SwasthSip, we’ve taken that tradition and turned it into a tasty, soulful drink that fits perfectly into
          today’s fast-paced life. Made with horse gram flour, jaggery, ghee, vermicelli, and a mix of almonds, cashews,
          and optional sunflower and watermelon seeds, this ganji is both nourishing and nostalgic
